5 STEP PROBLEM SOLVING 

1.DEFINE THE PROBLEM


knowing the problem inside and out is half the battle.

if i had an hour to solve the problem, i'd spend 55 minutes on the problem and the other 5 min on the solution.

What are the assumptions being made?
What are the parameters being made?
What goal are wen trying to meet?


   Ways to better understand the problem...
      -try visualizing the problem by sketching it out on paper
      -Describe the problem in your own words

if your able to appropriately articulate the problem to someone it betters your chance in the solution coming to light




2.BREAK THE PROBLEM DOWN APART INTO SMALLER SECTIONS

Identify the MAIN GOALS and then the SUB-GOALS.


Identify the constraints for each SUB-GOAL.



3. Identifying potential solutions

There is almost always more than one way to solve the problem.
	Ways to identify potential solutions.

		1. Look at the sub-problems to see if you can create a solution
		2. Can you generalize to make the solution work for the whole problem?
		3. Don't worry about if the actually work or not. Just brainstorm possible directions.



4.  Here's where you brake down the identified potential solutions. Does it work, or does it work for all of them.

		1. which solution meet the goals?
		2. Does the solution work for all classes?
		3. There may be more than one solution. Rank them to see which works best.




5. How will it work?

test test test test and test!
